# Repository for Streamlit Assignment for Mini-Project
thsi project is about  flower classification. we trained our model on flower classification dataset and then used it to built a streamlit web app that will predict the labels of flower out of five categories; [tulip, dandelions, daisy, sunflower and roses].
we have built this repo using vscode. app.py is the main file that loads the model and use it for predictions.We have also used some test images to validate our results.
